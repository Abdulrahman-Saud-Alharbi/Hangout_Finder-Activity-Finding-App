#Hangout Finder

The HangoutFinder is an app that lets friends pick a hangout spot in a fun and convienient way. It lets users login or signup, then lets them choose the city they are in, then it shows a list of fun activites that the user and their friends can do. You can filter the activites by number of people and price, then you can choose whether to pick an activty yourself or have the app choose it randomly for you. The app displays all the places in your city that match with your activity, it does this by connection to the Google Map API.
